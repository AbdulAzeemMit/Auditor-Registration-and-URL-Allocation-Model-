# Auditor-Registration-and-URL-Allocation-Model-
National Informatics Center (NIC) is a government organization. NIC host many government
websites. As we all know that these government websites faces many cyber attacks from
different parts of world. So it is also the responsibility of NIC to resolve these threats/attacks.
NIC follows the given procedure to resolve these attacks. In NIC Admin and Auditors are fully
responsible for resolving these attacks. 
- **Admin:**
In NIC, an Admin is a Scientist-B grade officer. The owner of the website facing threat
sends an e-mail with necessary details to the Admin. The Admin uses various tools and
categorize these threats. Then he/she prepares a report and sends it to the concerning
department. There is also possibility that the report is send to more than one department via e-mail. 
- **Auditor:**
Auditor is an outsourced officer or officer of the concerned department specifically
dealing with the particular threat. The Admin sends the e-mail to the Auditor of
concerning department. After this, it is the responsibility of the Auditor to completely
resolve the threats and response back to the Admin. 

There was no such efficient tool or model that could deal with both the Auditors and Admin and
can respond to their requests. All the work mechanism is manual and the communication is based
on e-mail. It is very complex for the admin to save the records of all the Auditors. In order to
remove this complexity and increase transparency and efficiency, develop ‘Auditor Registration
and URL Allocation Model’. The purpose of ‘Auditor Registration and URL Allocation Model’
can be specified in two major roles:

1. **Admin:** 
The dashboard for the Admin is purely related to the control of assignment of
URLs to a particular auditor, registration of auditor, edit/delete auditors and View the
reports related to the assigned URLs.

2. **Auditor:** The dashboard for the Auditor related to view and submit the URLs assigned to
him/her
